# Letters in Gnarpanese
The letters in Gnarpanese use the latin alphabet as their script, and make similar sounds. There
aren't many vowels that are used in Gnarpanese, but these are enough for complex thoughts to be formed.

# Consonants

## Consonant grid
|         | Bilabial | Labiodental | Dental | Alveolar | Alveopalatal | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |   Clusters   |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|----------|--------------|---------|-------|---------| ------------ |

*If a letter in the consonant grid is in parenthesis, that is what is being written. For example,*
> "h" is pronouned /θ/

### Clusters
If you're apt enough, you may notice the [e]/ks/ cluster. Why is there [e]? I'll explain. At the start of any word,
the /eks/ cluster is used for the x sound. If the "x" letter is found anywhere that *is not* there, the /ks/ sound
is used (/e/ is omitted)


# Vowels

## Vowel Grid
|					|    Front    | Central | Back |
|---------| ----------- | ------- | ---- |
|Close	  |e(i&e),eˑ(y) |					|			 |
|Close-mid|	 				    |					|	 ɔ(o)|
|Open-mid |	  					|					|	 	   |
|Open	 	  |						  |		 ɶ(a)	|			 |

If a vowel is seen twice, e.g. in `Gloobl`, (only exception is /eˑ/), then the
"long" supersegmental is added. For example,
> Gloobl (/ɢlɔ**ː**bl/)

does have that supersegmental after /ɔ/.
