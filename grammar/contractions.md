# Contractions in Gnarpanese
In gnarpanese, contractions are quite common. They're formed by taking the first
three letters of the root of the verb, and adding them two together. For example,

> Gloobl mynzing

which translates to `I am going`, can be shortened to
> Gloobl'myn

which translates to `I'm going` (obviously)
