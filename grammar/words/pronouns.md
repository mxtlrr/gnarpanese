# Pronouns in Gnarpanese

## Posessive
*Gnarpanese is a gender neutral language, thus only one pronoun*
*exists for 3rd person*

|  Pronoun  | Gnarpanese Equivalent | Sound (IPA) |
| --------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
|1st Person | Gloobl                |  /ɢlɔːbl/   |
|2nd Person | Zlorp                 |  /zlɔɹp/    |
|3rd Person | Morb                  |  /mɔɹb/     |
|3rd Person\*| Morba                |  /mɔɹbɶ/    |

*The last two entries are a bit confusing, as there is no seperation from
each other. However, the last entry is the neuter gender. The 2nd to last
entry (and the first "3rd person" entry) is in the 
[Epicene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicenity) / plural gender.*
