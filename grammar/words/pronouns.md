# Pronouns in Gnarpanese

## Posessive
*Gnarpanese is a gender neutral language, thus only one pronoun*
*exists for 3rd person*

|  Pronoun  | Gnarpanese Equivalent | Sound (IPA) |
| --------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
|1st Person | Gloobl                |  /ɢlɔːbl/   |
|2nd Person | Zlorp                 |  /zlɔɹp/    |
|3rd Person | Morb                  |  /mɔɹb/     |
|3rd Person\*| Morba                |  /mɔɹbɶ/    |

*The last two entries are a bit confusing, as there is no seperation from
each other. However, the last entry is the neuter gender. The 2nd to last
entry (and the first "3rd person" entry) is in the 
[Epicene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicenity) / plural gender.*

## Interrogative

| Interrogative Pronoun | Gnarpanese Equivalent | Sound (IPA) |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Who                   | Glib                  | /ɢleb/      |
| Whom                  | Gliby                 | /ɢlebeˑ/    |
| Whose                 | Glibak                | /ɢlebɶk/    |
| What                  | Zorb                  | /zɔɹb/      |
| Which                 | Zorbl                 | /zɔɹbl/     |

## Reflexive & Reciprocal

### Reflexive
The reflexive pronouns are suffixes that are just added on to the first
three letters of the posessive pronoun they are changing. For example,
translation of "myself" into gnarpanese would be
> Glomil

| Reflexive Pronoun | Gnarpanese Equivalent | Sound (IPA) |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| -self             | -mil                  | /mel/       |
| -selves           | -him                  | /θem/       |

The `-selves` reflexive pronoun is only used for 3rd person. If you're
using the neuter gender (for 3rd person), you will use the first four letters.
For example, "Morhim" corresponds to the epicene gender (themselves).

However, "Morbhim" is not valid. You *must* use the `-mil` suffix, e.g.
> Morbmil
